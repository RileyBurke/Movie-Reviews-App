Movie Review App - Riley Burke

Assignment 1 Submission - May 18th 2022: https://github.com/RileyBurke/Movie-Reviews-App/commit/6de5533a523c02ab34f1ecbfdbd5bc3c4de311dc

Assignment 2 Submission - May 26th 2022: Current version.

Both bonuses completed, to test the JSON upload you can find the API key for the route in the server file. Keep in mind the images will not work unless they are already uploaded on the server.

I will provide an BonusFiles folder containing a json file movies.json with JSON data containing existing image paths and those image files in my d2l submission.

If you then remove the movies from the App the images will be deleted from the server as well.

For an AWS link please contact me on Teams and I will log in and start it.Â
